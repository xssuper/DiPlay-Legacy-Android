 * Milestone M4 of the Android mode plan: exactly one projection mode may own the hotspot, the USB
 * device and the local ADB link at any moment. This is the decision half — it emits commands and
 * never touches Android, so every transition is covered by a JVM test.
 *
 * The runtime half (in `common`) maps [MirrorArbiterEffect] onto real work: stopping the CarPlay
 * controller, releasing the access point, starting the Android receiver. Keeping them apart is what
 * makes "两部手机同时插入" and "运行中拔插" reproducible without hardware.
